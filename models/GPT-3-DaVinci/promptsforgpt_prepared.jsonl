We'd prefer a sharper screen.   Looking for something a little bigger? Perhaps getting an  HP 17.3-inch HD Plus Touchscreen Laptop for $300 off  is more to your liking. Regularly priced at $799, it's not a convertible like the x360, but you get the SSD, an optical drive and a huge 17.3-inch screen, albeit running at a modest  1,600x900 pixels. "}

CNET hasn't reviewed the BodyBoss, but user ratings around the interwebs are generally very positive. Last time I ran this deal, it was $135 for the four-band version. "}

Xfinity Mobile is offering new and existing customers up to $750 off the purchase of a new Galaxy S22 when trading in their current device. However, the terms of this deal are a bit more complex than others.  The savings of up to $750 off the S22 lineup comes in pieces and is less direct than other discounts on this list, having three separate components. First, customers who trade in a device that's in working condition and sign up for a new line will receive a Visa prepaid card with a value of up to $200. Note that the card expires 180 days after it is issued and in order to qualify, your line must remain active for 15 days following the trade-in. In addition to that, customers who trade in a device that is accepted by Xfinity's partner, Assurant, will also receive up to $150 back. And finally, customers will receive up to $400 off the purchase of one of the Galaxy S22 models on an existing Xfinity Mobile line or with a new line activation and porting of phone number within 30 days of purchase. This will require a 24-month-long device payment contract and, if canceled or paid off early, the balance of credits associated with your device payment are forfeited.   Be sure you understand all the terms of this deal prior to purchase. Select models of the S22 and S22 Plus are available now, while all models of the S22 Ultra are on backorder until April 1 at the earliest. "}

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Westinghouse 70-inch 4K UHD Smart Roku TV for $385 with an $120 off + Save 30% with the Target Circle coupon discount","completion":"  Here are the steps to claim this deal:    Save this  30% off coupon  by creating a free Target Circle account. The account will come in handy when you pick up the TV at your local store.   Add the TV to your cart using the  \"Pick up here\" option . Note that you must do in-store pickup to redeem this offer, and stock and availability will vary based on your location.    When you checkout, the total discount should be reflected in the order summary.    So, what's the deal with this TV?    On the surface, a lot of the specifications and features on this TV are  nothing out of the ordinary: 4K UHD resolution, Smart Roku TV,  voice-controllable via Alexa and Google Assistant. It also comes with four HDMI 2.0 ports and two slots for USB. Pretty good so far.  It's not often that a 70-inch flat-screen can be had for  as little as $385,  so there are bound to be some corners cut here and  there. In the case  of this Westinghouse unit, one of the compromises is  the integration of  screen-saver ads. They will appear on the screen as  you browse  applications and inputs, or when you've left the TV idle.

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Original Prusa i3 MK3S+ with an Best all-around prosumer hobby printer under $1,000 discount","completion":" You can't fully appreciate the Original Prusa i3 MK3S without knowing the story of Josef Průša, a Czech maker and inventor. Průša was an active participant in the open-source RepRap community back in the early hobbyist 3D printing days. He designed two upgraded Mendel printers, each time simplifying the design and improving reliability. His last hobby project was the i3, a substantial improvement on earlier designs. Based on the i3 (which has been cloned by many companies around the world), Průša began producing parts for hobbyists to buy and assemble. And thus was born the original Original Prusa i3.  Fast forward nearly a decade and Prusa Research is one of the fastest-growing tech companies in Central Europe, and the Original Prusa i3 series (which has had three major design iterations) and in 2016 was the most-used 3D printer in the world. What we like about the i3 MK3S+ is how reliable and robust it is, how smartly the device trams the build plate, and how inexpensive the machine is for all it does. Fully assembled, the Original Prusa i3 MK3S+ is $999, but those with a little more time on their hands and a hankering for adventure, there's a $749 kit if you're willing to assemble it yourself.  If you're on a budget, hop on over to our  best budget 3D printers list  and check out the Prusa MINI+. It's one of our top picks.

The table was the boomiest sounding model when plugged into the same phono preamplifier as the others. When I tested its own preamp it was much less bassy, though also less exciting, and this was presumably due to a better match with the cartridge.   Though the Music Hall's onboard preamp sounded better, the Audio-Technica could be the one to get if you want an all-in-one package that also looks great. "}

Simultaneous connections:  Unspecified   Kill switch:  No idea   Logging:  None   Countries:  8   Our next contender is LimeVPN, and ... I'm not entirely sure about these folks. They claim a $1 per month service on their home page, which would make them the least expensive on this list. But when you click the Join Now button, that offer is nowhere to be found. It turns out you first have to hit the Join Now button, see the more expensive offering, click into that offering, and then sign up for the two-year plan. Whew. Way to promote your best plan, LimeVPN!  We also couldn't find out anything about who was providing this service. The About page says, \"LimeVPN is a team of skilled IT professionals with more than 10 years experience in the IT industry.\" So, is that 10 folks with a year of experience each? Or two guys with five years of experience each? Or does each worker have a decade of experience? It doesn't matter, because this service is cheap, cheap, cheap.  On the plus side, the company says it uses 256-bit encryption with a 2048-bit key (over the usual VPN protocols). Interestingly, the company also states, \"No 3rd parties -- Our own VPN servers, our DNS, our code, our engineers.\" It could be interesting if they control their own servers, even if they only operate in eight countries.  Also, the service doesn't come with any of the usual VPN apps. The service does have a hefty help library, but you'll need to find and configure your own VPN programs to use LimeVPN. So, there's that. "}

The company was incubated in the Axel Springer Plug and Play Accelerator and looks to have some German venture capital funding.  In terms of client experience, the service offers simple one-click, clean and well-designed apps. Additionally, there are installation guides for using ZenMate with smart TVs, routers, and gaming platforms.  I do have some concerns due to  an exposé  posted by my CNET colleague Rae Hodge. In it, she points out that ZenMate was purchased in 2018 by notorious scareware provider Kape Technologies. The company claims it has given up its evil ways, but before installing ZenMate on your systems, I recommend you read Rae's article.  *Same caution as above. \"Unlimited\" is never truly unlimited.

Designed by the same Swedish company that makes Urbanears headphones, it sounds quite decent, with well-balanced sound that doesn't push the bass too much.   I found them comfortable  for on-ear headphones, which tend not to be as comfortable as over-ear  headphones, but those with larger heads may feel they clamp down a  little too snugly on both your head and your ears. This set of  headphones is sweat-resistant with an IPX4 certification. Also, the ear  cushions and inner headband are removable and washable (there are  instructions  for  how to do this, but Adidas should do a how-to video). The RPT-01 is available in three colors. "}

You can also purchase both plans for just $50\/mo. Sling TV offers 50 hours of DVR storage to hold all your recorded episodes and it's compatible with a number of popular devices, like Roku, Apple TV, Xbox One and Xbox Series X\/S, and Google Chromecast.  Another very cool feature that Sling has is Watch Party. If you and your friends all have Sling, you can start a Watch Party and \"watch\" your favorite shows together. Sling TV is also a valid option for  sports  fans.   Cons   The channel selection is a bit lacking, with Sling Blue at more than 45 channels and Sling Orange at over 30 channels. Even when you get the combined Sling Orange & Blue plan at more than 50 channels, you still aren't getting as many channels as the over 85 channels that Hulu or YouTube TV offer.

The DVR function also allows you to fast-forward, pause, and rewind. The price clocks in around what most cable packages might cost. Also, because YouTube TV falls under the Google umbrella, you can program your Google Home to control it.  YouTube TV  also offers a free trial.   Cons   YouTube TV is good for replacing cable but not necessarily for on-demand streaming of other content.

Like the Buds Pro, the Buds 2 are equipped with active noise-isolating earbuds. That means all the latest Galaxy Buds models now feature some form of active noise canceling, though it's slight with the Buds Live, which have an open design sans ear tips. While the Buds 2 look more like shrunken versions of the Buds Pro, I found them more akin to the Buds Live in that they barely stick out of your ears and are fairly discrete.

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Xbox One S: $299 bundle with an Save up to $70 discount","completion":" This is the return of Walmart's \"build a bundle\" deal from Black Friday.

I can see why: It's a splash-proof, Bluetooth 5.0 speaker that promises up to 24 hours of uninterrupted play time.   And, remember, not every situation demands premium audio. If you just want to, say, listen to a podcast while gardening or have a bit of music in the background while you work, this is eight measly dollars and change well-spent.

{"prompt":"Make a description about an QKK true-1080p mini projector with screen with an $100 with coupon discount","completion":"  Amazon seller:  QKK Direct   Price:  $100 with on-page $50-off coupon  A  lot  of low-price projectors list \"1080p\" in their specs, but in many cases that means they support 1080p  sources  (which is just about anything you'd be plugging in these days). What you want is native 1080p resolution, which this QKK model has.  Update:  I can no longer find any mention of native 1080p resolution on the listing page for this projector, and in fact there's no information at all regarding the actual resolution -- only what's \"supported.\" I've reached out to the vendor for clarification and would suggest canceling any order you might have placed. My apologies for the confusion.   Update No. 2:  The vendor confirmed that the native resolution is 720p, not 1080p. Once again, I sincerely regret the error.  It also comes with a 100-inch portable screen and an HDMI cable, nice extras given the price.  Although it has built-in speakers, this isn't a \"true\" portable projector because it needs power. It also needs a pretty dark room and some kind of video source: Roku Stick, game console, flash drive, even SD card. Assuming you can find just the right spot for placement (which is the challenge with most projectors), this looks like a pretty sweet deal on a 1080p model. "}

This tier is largely the same as the old PS Plus and includes:    Two monthly downloadable games  Store discounts  Cloud saves   Online multiplayer    Current PS Plus subscribers transitioned to this tier on June 13.    Extra  includes the benefits of the Essential tier while adding a catalog of up to 400 PS4 and PS5 games available for downloading. The catalog includes first- and third-party games including  Death Stranding ,  God of War ,  Spider-Man ,  Spider-Man: Miles Morales ,  Mortal Kombat 11  and  Returnal . This tier costs $15 a month, or $100 per year.    Premium  has features from both tiers and adds an additional 340 classic games to stream from the PlayStation 1, PS2, PS3 and PSP.

Premium also has time-limited game trials that let you play the game for two hours before deciding to buy it.   The Premium tier costs $18 a month or $120 per year.

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Old PS Now with an $10 per month discount","completion":" Cloud gaming may be hot right now, with major players like Google Stadia, Amazon Luna and Microsoft's  Xbox Cloud Gaming  beta, but it was Sony that first tried to make cloud gaming mainstream with PS Now in 2014. Earlier pioneers like OnLive and Gaikai (both eventually purchased by Sony) are now largely forgotten. More than 800 PS2, PS3, PS4 and PS5 games are available to stream or download on the PS4, PS5 or PC.   But lag remains a factor, like with other cloud gaming services. Game resolution has been recently updated from 720p to 1080p for some games, but that falls behind the 4K offered by Stadia. There's also a lack of newer titles in its library. Even major titles published by Sony such as The Last of Us Part 2 aren't on the service, nor is there any indication that they will be added. Those games that are added sometimes don't stay in the library for that long, with some available on PS Now for as little as three months. On the plus side, many of the PS4 games on the service can be downloaded rather than streamed, and there's a PC client for cloud gaming on computers as well.   PS Now subscribers automatically converted to the Premium PS Plus tier on June 13. "}

It offers solid battery life,  6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and 6.2-inch display. It doesn't have wireless charging or water resistance, but it's tough to beat at that price.  In addition to the Google Pixel 4a 5G deal, Google has great discounts ranging from $100 to $500 off with activation on Google Fi. There are deals on the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, S20, and A71, as well as a couple of Motorola phone deals. You must check out these Google Fi deals. "}

The Google Pixel 5 isn't the most powerful smartphone, when it comes to specifications, but it has arguably the best camera system on a phone, brings 5G to the table, and is fairly affordable at $699 ($649 for Black Friday). You should still receive this phone in time for the Christmas holiday, but you better order one fast.  Given the extremely poor battery life of the Pixel 4, you should probably consider trading it in for the Pixel 5 which will save you even more money.

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Anycubic Mega Zero 2.0 with an Under $200 filament 3D printer discount","completion":" What would a David gift guide be without a 3D printer or two? While Anycubic has been building a reputation for its great resin printers, they also produce FDM (fused deposition modeling) printers. This one, at under $200, would make a great gift.  What I like about it (besides the price) is that it can handle multiple filament materials and has a fairly generous 220 x 220 x 250mm build volume. You do have to do your own leveling (there's no automatic option), but the comfortable leveling knobs make it a pretty straightforward process. Two other great features are a magnetic build bed, which makes parts removal easier, and a resume-from-outage feature that picks up printing if the power fails.  AnyCubic has this on sale on its own site, but they tell me that there are sometimes discounted units to be found on eBay. I'm including both links below. Also, stay tuned. I have an innovative Anycubic SLA printer and a special curing station in the Fab Lab. I'll be looking at them in-depth early in 2021. "}

{"prompt":"Make a description about an US Mobile Galaxy S21 deals with an Up to $250 off your first year of service discount","completion":" US Mobile isn't offering to sell you a Galaxy S21; rather, it's offering to give you discounted service when you buy the phone elsewhere (like from Samsung, above) and bring it to US Mobile for service.   It would play out like this: You buy a US Mobile SIM card (using promo code  SG21 , which should be automatically applied for you), then sign up for the service plan of your choice. Every month you stay with US Mobile, you'll receive 50% off that plan, for a maximum 12-month savings of $250.  This isn't a contract, though, and there's no penalty if you decide to walk away after, say, six months. After that first year is up, your plan will automatically revert to the standard rate.  One new plan that's worth a look: Unlimited talk and text and 30GB of high-speed data for $30 a month. The discount would shave that to $15 a month for the entire first year. "}

Oxenfree calls itself a \"supernatural teen thriller,\" but deftly avoids tropes and cliches, providing characters with depth and a fascinating, eerie plot. It's a quick game you could play in one sitting, but there's multiple endings so you can always go back.  Plus, Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals is coming in 2022, so now is a perfect time to play (or replay!) the original game.  "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an Gris with an Price: $5 discount","completion":" Gris is a beautiful game about dealing with traumatic experiences in life. It's a stunning platformer with remarkable color and hand-drawn detail. It tells the story of a young woman struggling after a painful experience to find redemption, understanding and forgiveness.   Gris' landscapes and gameplay bring to mind the Alto series (Snowman) and Monument Valley (UsTwo). Developers at Nomada Studios use color, music, light, even the woman's clothing, to convey emotion and further the story -- which is intentionally left ambiguous. As you progress in the game, the woman picks up new abilities to help her along the journey through forests, underwater caverns, deserts and towering buildings.  Gris uses stunning visuals to talk about resilience, strength, recovery and hope. You don't \"die\" in the game -- it's more about trying again, which speaks to the larger theme. This was one of the first games I tried when I bought an iPad. It's a must-play. "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an Eloh with an Price: $3 discount","completion":" Eloh is somehow addicting, relaxing and educational at the same time. It's a visually stunning musical puzzle game that teases your brain without stressing you out. Eloh is perfect for adults, or for teaching your kids without them knowing they're being taught.   Each level features island spirits that you can move. Once you get them into the right spot, tap the red speaker and music will start. The goal is to bounce the \"sound waves\" off the spirits and hit the spiral icon -- kind of like banking a shot in billiards. It's also ultra satisfying when you get the pattern right and the new song plays. "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an Monument Valley and Monument Valley 2 with an Price: $4, $5 discount","completion":" The Monument Valley series is absolutely lovely. In the game, you must help Princess Ida on a mission through Monument Valley -- a world of mazes, crow people and strange, impossible structures. The environment is interactive, requiring you to twist, drag and turn the buildings to find paths for Ida.   Monument Valley 2 has all the stuff you loved about the first game, but stands on its own as an original story and takes a step forward as a more sophisticated narrative and style. In this game, you must guide Ro and her child through Monument Valley. Both games are simultaneously challenging and relaxing.   You can buy Monument Valley and Monument Valley 2 in the App Store, or you can check out  Monument Valley Plus on Apple Arcade . Monument Valley Plus provides a fully unlocked version of the original game with an extra level.  Ustwo is probably one of my favorite game developers. From the Monument Valley games to  Assemble With Care  on Apple Arcade, its stuff is always a home run.  "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an Alto's Adventure and Alto's Odyssey with an Price: $5 discount","completion":"  Alto's Adventure  is to endless runners what Monument Valley is to puzzle games. The game puts a new twist on sports adventure as you -- as Alto -- snowboard across scenic hills, down gorgeous mountainsides, and through villages with day-to-night transitions. It's all set to a lovely soundtrack as well.   If you liked Alto's Adventure, Snowman put out a follow-up standalone game. This time, Alto and his friends embark on a sandboarding adventure in the desert. Everything you loved about the first game is still there, just in a different environment.  Collect coins, avoid obstacles, and time and land your jumps to gain speed boosts. The more tricks you land, the longer your scarf grows.  You can purchase Alto's Adventure and Alto's Odyssey separately in the App Store, or you can check out  Alto's Odyssey: The Lost City , a fully unlocked version of the game with a bonus level, on Apple Arcade.

{"prompt":"Make a description about an What Remains of Edith Finch with an Price: $5 discount","completion":" What Remains of Edith Finch is a dark, emotional journey through the seemingly cursed Finch family tree. Edith Finch, the last living member of her family, travels back home to explore her family's massive home. The house seems to go on forever and is packed with rooms and secret passages to explore.   The game plays out like a series of short stories, giving the player a snapshot of Edith's ancestors. As you progress, Edith maps out her family tree in a notebook. What Remains of Edith Finch is a walking simulator, mystery puzzle game and it's engrossing enough to play in one sitting.   Without giving too much away, the game is dark -- it contains themes of human and animal death, suicide, mental illness, and more. It's a good game, but if you're triggered by any of these topics (or topics that could be related), I might think twice about playing this one.  "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an Solitaire Stories with an Price: Apple Arcade subscription ($5 a month) discount","completion":" I've always loved Solitaire, whether it was the built-in PC game or an actual deck of cards. When Solitaire Stories landed on Apple Arcade, I was excited to play digital Solitaire without ads, as well as see Red Games' fresh take on the classic.   Solitaire Stories weaves a narrative into the card game. There are eight stories to unlock with different deck themes and points to earn. The more you play, the more difficult the stories and hands become. You can also opt for the quick play option if you've already played the story through, or just want a round of Solitaire. My favorite story to play was the Maestro story, which dealt with a musician's journey and presented a gorgeous purple aesthetic.   In addition, Solitaire Stories says every hand is beatable, which keeps me trying the same deal over and over until I beat it. Stories are added monthly as well, so you can always experience something new. "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an Simon's Cat: Story Time with an Price: Apple Arcade subscription ($5 a month) discount","completion":" The Simon's Cat franchise -- which began as short animations about a man and his ever-hungry feline friend -- has blossomed since it's 2008 origins. You can find a number of Simon's Cat games in the App Store, but my favorite is Simon's Cat: Story Time on Apple Arcade.  Simon's Cat: Story Time keeps with the well-loved match-three gameplay that lets players unlock chapters of a story. In Story Time, a building site project threatens to shatter the tranquility of Simon and Cat's neighborhood. Simon, Cat, and their friends -- some four-legged -- begin restoring a wasteland of historic parks nearby to protect the community.   Story Time provides a fun narrative and soothing tasks of cleaning up and designing a garden (without breaking a sweat or getting dirty) alongside casual, easy-to-pick-up Candy Crush-style gameplay.  "}

Riders can also have information about Savy's disappearance. You can use the phone on your dashboard to pan around the in-game map, monitor your emotions and cash balance, driver rating and ride history, keep notes, and search for folks who need rides.  Be careful what you say (or don't say) and keep an eye on your Feelgrid bracelet to stay in tune with your emotions. The bracelet reports a spectrum of emotions by color and color intensity (i.e. angry is red, green is calm, dark red is furious, etc.) The longer you drive, the more difficult it becomes to please every passenger, get paid enough and land a good review. Too many bad reviews and you'll be out of a job. No pressure! "}

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Best for Current TV Shows: Hulu with an Price (starting at $7\/mo.) discount","completion":"  Pros   With its huge on-demand library,  Hulu  is one of the best TV streaming services. Hulu beats out Netflix with current programming, because episodes from current series are available on the service the day after they air live. You'll be able to stay up to date with what's happening on your favorite shows without having friends accidentally reveal plot lines.  At $7\/mo., Hulu is also one of the most  affordable  streamers.However, this is the service's basic, ad-supported plan. You do have the opportunity to upgrade the service and pay extra for an ad-free experience, add-ons, and live TV. And, since you're not locked into a plan, you can upgrade to the  live TV service  to watch specific live shows or events and then drop back down to the basic  Hulu plan  the following month. You can also sign up for the  Disney bundle  and get Hulu, Disney, and ESPN+ for $14\/mo. for the basic service or $20\/mo. for the Hulu (No ads) plan.   Cons   Unlike Netflix, the basic  Hulu plan  includes ads. To bypass ads entirely, you have to upgrade to the Hulu (No Ads) plan, which is $13\/mo., which is $3\/mo. more than what you'd pay for Netflix. It also doesn't have quite as large a content library as Netflix or  Amazon Prime Video .     What to Watch on Hulu   Hulu also has a robust library of original content that's worth watching, including its Emmy Award-winning show,  The Handmaid's Tale , in its fifth season. Other top originals currently airing are the drama,  Wu-Tang: An American Saga , now in its third and final season; the romantic drama,  Love, Victor , in its third and final season; the horror anthology show,  American Horror Stories , in its second season; the comedy,  Ramy , in its third season; the historical comedy,  The Great , in its third season; and teen comedy,  Reservation Dogs , in its second season.   Hulu's original library also includes acclaimed miniseries, such as the science fiction thriller  11.22.63 , based on Stephen King's novel of the same name;  The Looming Tower , about the rivalry between the FBI and CIA prior to 9\/11; and the true crime drama,  The Act . Hulu also offers next-day viewings of popular shows like  The Bachelor,   The Masked Singer ,  This Is Us , and more. "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an Best for Movies: HBO Max with an Price (starting at $10\/mo.) discount","completion":"  Pros   HBO has always been known for movies and  HBO Max  is no different. It is one of the best streaming sites for movies. All the movies you see in your cable menu for the HBO channels are available anytime on HBO Max.  In addition, HBO Max airs movies and shows from DC, Adult Swim, TCM, Cartoon Network, and Studio Ghibli. And, Warner Bros.' biggest hits are also available on HBO Max. Like Netflix and Hulu, HBO Max has its own lineup of original content that's immediately available to stream when it's airing on cable.  Meanwhile, HBO Max can be streamed in HD at the average internet download speed of 5 Mbps, or, if you have download speeds of 25Mbps, you can stream its content in 4K.   Cons   At $10\/mo., HBO Max costs the same as Netflix, but the HBO plan includes ads. To get the ad-free experience, you need to pay $15\/mo., which is the highest  priced  service we've looked at thus far. It's also lacking the variety of channels and shows the other services have. Additionally, you can't try it out first as HBO Max doesn't offer a  free trial .   What to Watch on HBO Max   HBO Max hosts all the HBO Originals, like  Game of Thrones  and  Euphoria , as well as Max Originals, like the Golden Globe-nominated  The Flight Attendant .   Other original programming currently airing include the team drama  Gossip Girl , the dark comedy  Made for Love , the sketch comedy  That Damn Michael Che , and the romantic comedy  And Just Like That.  Recent original films include the sci-fi romantic comedy  Moonshot , the crime thriller  Kimi , and the high school drama  The Fallout .   Plus,  Sesame Street , the entire Studio Ghibli collection, an array of anime, thanks to a deal with Crunchyroll, and beloved movies like  Rocky ,  Wedding Crashers ,  The Departed , and more are all available on HBO Max. "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an Best for Families: Disney+ with an Price ($8\/mo.) discount","completion":"  Pros   If you're looking for your favorite Disney movies and shows,  Disney+  is the only place you can stream them. This makes it the best streaming site for families. It also has plenty of its own original content to offer, as well as a large catalog of popular movies from years past all the way up to the present. This includes the library of Marvel and Star Wars films and TV series. You can also choose the  Disney Bundle , which, in addition to Disney+, comes with Hulu and ESPN+, and starts at $14\/mo.   Cons   The library of on-demand content for Disney+ is on the small side, but if you're looking for a streamer specifically for family content, this shouldn't be an issue. There's also less variety of available programming compared to Hulu or Netflix. If a show or movie is not in the Disney universe, it won't be on Disney+.   Additionally, the service does not offer a  free trial .   What to Watch on Disney+   Disney+ offers a nice library of original programming, especially in the science fiction and superhero genres. This includes Star Wars titles like  The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett,  and  Obi-Wan Kenobi ; and superhero shows like  WandaVision ,  The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Loki , and  Moon Knight . You'll also find Disney classics like  Dumbo,   The Lion King,  and  The Little Mermaid,  along with more recent favorites like  Frozen ,  Moana ,  Soul, Encanto , and more.  And fans of the theater can enjoy unlimited showings of  Hamilton . Disney+ also offers a number of fascinating documentaries that give you behind-the-scenes looks at the Disney company and its projects, like  Inside Pixar  and  Disney Gallery . You'll even find nostalgic movies and TV shows like  10 Things I Hate About You ,  Hannah Montana , and more. "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an Best for Budget: Apple TV+ with an Price ($5\/mo.) discount","completion":"  Pros   At $5\/mo.,  Apple TV+  is one of the most inexpensive of the services on our list. And, despite its low price, there are no ads in the programming. If you've purchased an Apple product, such as a computer, tablet, or iPhone, you can receive the service  free  for three months.  This makes Apple TV+ an ideal streaming service if you only have a few dollars to spare. Like the other providers, it also features original content you won't find anywhere else.   Cons   The Apple TV+ library is incredibly small and would probably only appeal to someone on a budget or who already has other streaming services. Its library strictly contains Apple TV+ originals, with TV shows, movies, and documentaries across various genres. However, the library is growing as new original content is added all the time.    What to Watch on Apple TV+   The award-winning series  Ted Lasso  and  The Morning Show  are among the most popular shows streaming on Apple TV+. Recent popular additions include the Oscar Award-winning film for Best Picture,  Coda ; the docuseries,  The Me You Can't See , on Prince Harry; and  Finch , a post-apocalyptic film starring Tom Hanks.  If you're a fan of  The Late Late Show With James Corden 's \"Carpool Karaoke,\" you can find an expanded series exclusively on Apple TV+. There are also fascinating documentaries, like  Beastie Boys Story  and  Billie Eilish: The World's a Little Blurry . "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an Best for a Little Bit of Everything: Amazon Prime Video with an Price ($13\/mo.) discount","completion":"  Pros    Amazon Prime Video  has a massive streaming library -- about triple the size of Netflix -- with thousands of movies and TV shows. It has a little bit of everything, including original content.   Prime Video is available at no extra charge to all Amazon Prime members, who pay $15\/mo. But if you don't want to be a full Amazon Prime member, you can still take advantage of Prime Video by subscribing solely to the video service for $9\/mo.   Cons   While Prime Video has a massive library, many top-quality titles are not included in the subscription. Many titles available through Prime Video require you to pay a rental fee that is over and above the monthly subscription fee you're already paying. This could cause your monthly rate to increase substantially.   What to Watch on Amazon Prime Video   Award-winning titles like  Fleabag  and the Amazon Original  The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel , as well as newer shows like  The Wilds  and  The Boys  are all binge-worthy. Among the Amazon originals currently airing are the political thriller  Jack Ryan , in its second season; the fantasy series  Carnival Row , in its season two; the crime drama,  Reacher , in its second season; and the romantic comedy  With Love , in its season two.   You'll also find hits like  Coming 2 America  and  One Night in Miami , as well as other award-winning shows and movies exclusive to Amazon Prime. "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an Best for Sports: Peacock with an Price (Free, but with plans starting at $5\/mo.) discount","completion":"  Pros   Peacock is the only streaming platform on our list that has a free plan. If you sign up for free, you'll get access to Peacock's on-demand library of over 40,000 hours of TV shows and movies, along with more than 50 channels.   The service also offers a Premium plan for $5\/mo. and Plus plan for $10\/mo. The Premium plan comes with ads and includes more than 60,000 hours of programming, next day access to NBC's current hit shows and all of the network's live events.   The Plus plan provides ad-free viewing and the opportunity to watch shows offline. It has a vast amount of sports programming, including Olympics, Super Bowl, Premier League, and WWE.   Cons   Since the service is owned by NBCUniversal, it primarily features content from the studio's library, including shows and movies from NBC, Universal Pictures, and Universal Television. This limits the amount and variety of programming available.   What to Watch on Peacock   Like all the other streaming services, Peacock offers its own original programming. This includes  Bel-Air , a reboot of the '90s sitcom,  The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air ;  Joe vs Carole , about Joe Exotic and Carole Baskin, the people behind Netflix's  Tiger King ; and the utopian drama  Brave New World .   The service also features all the movies in the Harry Potter series, along with feature films like Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson's  Marry Me , Gerard Butler's  Copshop , and the upcoming movie  Firestarter  featuring Zac Efron.

For a family of four, you can now get its Simply Unlimited plan for $80 per month ($20 per month, per line) which includes not only unlimited talk, text and data but also 5GB of mobile hotspot. There also is free roaming in Canada and Mexico, though taxes and fees are not included in the sticker price.

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Cricket Unlimited with an Runner-up: $100 a month for four lines discount","completion":" AT&T's prepaid brand has a decent deal if you're looking for four lines: $25 a month for unlimited talk, text and data. A single line is $55 a month, but Cricket gives a solid discount if you're willing to add more lines to the account.   Unlike Visible, however, this is a traditional-style family plan where one person pays for all the lines, so you may want to do this with people you know and can rely on to pay on time. While it's nearly identical in price, Visible's plan includes unlimited hotspot data, giving it the edge over Cricket. Like Visible, Cricket includes taxes in the price.   Cricket's T-Mobile rival Metro has a similar four lines for $100 a month unlimited deal, but you need to buy the plan in-store and switch providers to get the deal.  "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an TextNow with an Cheapest option without data: As low as $0 a month discount","completion":" If you're looking for service for a backup phone that's rarely used, TextNow has a free plan. Running on T-Mobile's network, the service offers  free unlimited talk and unlimited texting , though ads are placed in its app which you use to call and text people. There isn't any data included with this option and removing the ads without adding data would run you $10 a month. If you want to watch YouTube, FaceTime, or surf the web make sure to connect to Wi-Fi.   Text messages are also done through the company's TextNow app, not through iMessage or WhatsApp which makes sense as those services require data.   Getting 1GB of high-speed mobile data starts at $9 a month, with the company throttling you down to \"2G speeds\" if you use that up before your billing cycle resets. If you are largely on Wi-Fi, this could be a good option. 2GB runs $16 a month, with the company offering up to 5GB of high-speed data for $28 a month.  "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an Boost 1GB Plan with an Cheapest option with limited data: One year with 1GB per month for $100 discount","completion":" US Mobile has a good option for 5GB of data for $15 a month, which beats comparably priced offers from Mint ($15 a month for 4GB of data), Boost Mobile ($15 for 2GB of data) and others.   Boost, however, has a $100 deal for new customers that  offers 1GB of data per month for a full year . That breaks down to $8.33 a month. Boost offers service on AT&T and T-Mobile's networks today, though parent company Dish is in the process of building out its own wireless network.   If you don't have Boost, largely use Wi-Fi (but still want some data) and price is the biggest driver for you, then this is the go-to pick for a new service.

Citizens Access mostly provides home loans,  student loan refinancing  and a high-yield savings account.  Without physical branches or paper statements, Citizens Access passes savings to customers with a strong 3.00% APY, though it does require a rather hefty minimum $5,000 deposit. It's not clear if the fees for Citizens Access differ from its traditional bank parent group -- Citizen Bank lists fees of $20 for outgoing domestic wire transfers and $50 for an international wire transfer.

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Varo Online Savings with an APY: 2.00% to 5.00%; minimum deposit: $0 discount","completion":" There's always a wild card -- Varo provides the only notable banking innovation on our list, with a tiered savings rate that encourages low balances. Varo will give you 5.00% APY back if your daily balance never goes over $5,000 during an entire monthly billing cycle. If it gets above $5,000, you'll get 2.00% on the entire balance for that month.  To qualify for any interest at all, you'll need  to have $1,000 in direct deposits every month. Along with the minimum in direct deposits, the following unique balance requirements apply: to earn 2.00% APY, your daily average balance for a month must be at least $4.95 (31-day months) or $5.12 (30-day months). To earn 5.00% APY, your average daily balance for the month must be at least $1.21 (31-day months) or $1.25 (30-day months).  While Varo presents a tempting APY for those with lower balances, the requirement of $1,000 in direct deposits each month means you'll need to be constantly moving money out of your savings account in order to achieve the 5.00% rate.  With a $5,000 balance at Varo, you'd currently earn $256 in interest in a year. With a $10,000 balance at Varo, you'd currently earn $202 in interest in a year.  "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an Bay Alarm Medical with an Best in-home medical alert: Starting at $20 per month, $0 equipment fee, $0 activation fee discount","completion":" Home-based medical alerts are ideal for those who don't leave the house often. They can't be used on the go (like at the grocery store), since they have to stay connected to an in-home base unit. But they work in the yard or even a few houses down, as long as you find one with good range -- like this medical alert from Bay Alarm Medical.  Bay Alarm Medical's in-home medical alert can be used either with a landline or cellular service. Choose between pendant or wristband help buttons, both waterproof with a reported range of 800 to 1,000 feet from the base station. It also comes with four help buttons to put on the wall.  This is a monitored system, which means the help button has 24\/7 access to emergency operators who can dispatch local authorities and\/or call loved ones if needed. All monitored systems require a monthly fee, and Bay Alarm's price is very reasonable compared to other companies, with no additional startup fees. Users report quick response times and high-quality service from Bay Alarm's operators. You can also add on fall detection -- a feature that can automatically detect a fall and send an emergency alert on the wearer's behalf.  While this medical alert doesn't come with extra features, like medicine reminders or fitness tracking, its affordability, reliability and ease of use make it our top pick for an in-home alert. "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an MobileHelp Classic with an An in-home medical alert with perks: Starting at $35 per month, $0 equipment fee, $0 activation fee discount","completion":" If you do want some more features with your in-home medical alert system, MobileHelp Classic is a solid choice. It comes with a suite of useful tools for users and caregivers alike through its app, MobileHelp Connect, including the ability to see recent locations or send a location request. You can add on medication reminder services at an additional $5 per month, plus activity tracking for another $5 per month. Fall detection is also available at $10 per month.  MobileHelp's system doesn't have a landline option -- it only works over a cellular network (in this case, AT T's). The waterproof help button comes in lanyard or wristband form, with a reported range of 1,400 feet from the base unit. The base unit has a backup battery with up to 30 hours of power, which is helpful in case of a power outage. MobileHelp offers 24\/7 US-based monitoring, with quick response times and a courteous, professional response team, according to customer reviews.   If you opt in to all the extras, you're looking at a monthly cost of around $55 -- but MobileHelp offers a range of ways to cut that price down, including discounts, frequent promos and the ability to choose from monthly, quarterly, semiannual or annual payment plans.

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Lively Mobile Plus with an Best on-the-go medical alert: Starting at $25 per month, $50 equipment fee, $35 activation fee discount","completion":" Unlike in-home medical alerts, mobile systems don't require a base unit, which means that you can use them anywhere -- at the store, on the road, or anywhere else there's cell service. They're ideal for active older or disabled people who leave the house often.  This on-the-go medical alert from Lively offers the best combination of features and affordability that we could find, making it our top recommendation for a mobile system. Instead of a pendant or wristband, it consists of a small help button that can be clipped to practically anything, including your belt, purse or a lanyard.   One potential drawback to mobile alerts is battery life -- like all portable electronics, they have to be recharged regularly in order to work. But the Lively Mobile Plus has a generous 80 hours of battery life, so you don't have to worry about plugging it in every single night. Another benefit: GPS tracking is included with the Mobile Plus for no extra cost.   One feature that sets the Mobile Plus apart is the option to get 24\/7 access, not only to an emergency call center but also to urgent care, allowing you to talk to a doctor or nurse anytime. With that feature included, you're still looking at only $30 per month, or $40 per month if you want fall detection as well. (AARP members get a discount on Lively products.) "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an Philips Lifeline GoSafe 2 with an Best location tracking: $50 per month, $100 device fee discount","completion":" If location tracking is a priority for you, one medical alert system stands out above the rest: the Philips Lifeline GoSafe 2. It uses five locating technologies for tracking, including GPS, Wi-Fi and audio beaconing, which allows for a more accurate reading  and  offers several back-up options in case one technology isn't working.  The GoSafe 2 is a little pricey -- it costs $50 per month, and device activation is extra, though there's a discount for AARP members. That price gets you access to a 24\/7 emergency operations center based in Canada, plus free fall detection. In this case, you only have the option for a help button pendant (no wristband is available), which has a rechargeable battery that lasts up to two or three days, though some users say it's a bit bulky to wear.  The GoSafe 2 doesn't come with access to medical professionals, or extra perks like activity tracking. But Philips is a trusted brand with a long history in the medical alert industry, and with its quick response times and advanced location tracking, this is still a great medical alert for the right person.

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Bay Alarm SOS with an Best medical alert smartwatch: $30 per month, $179 for equipment discount","completion":" Tech-savvy users might think you can simply use any smartwatch as a medical alert. After all, you're always wearing it anyway, and you can use it to make emergency calls. But a dedicated medical alert smartwatch is different -- it allows you to simply press an SOS button and get quick access to a 24\/7 emergency dispatch center or call your caregivers.   Some medical alert smartwatches require a smartphone, but the Bay Alarm SOS Smartwatch is functional all on its own. It has two-way calling, so if you press the help button, you can talk directly to the dispatcher through the smartwatch (and you can also talk to your loved ones). It also features location tracking and a built-in step tracker. The battery life ranges from six to 18 hours, depending on usage, and the device is  water resistant with a rating of IP67 . Note that it does not come with fall detection, as Bay Alarm says that technology is \"simply not accurate enough\" for its wrist devices.  In addition to the monthly fee, the SOS Smartwatch costs $179 to own the device outright. "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an Aloe Care Health with an Best all-in-one medical alert: Starting at $40 per month, $250 for equipment discount","completion":" Aloe Care Health claims to have \"the world's most advanced medical alert system.\" That's a pretty bold claim, but its system is definitely a more innovative version of the traditional medical alert, while still remaining accessible and easy to use. The Smart Hub allows you to access a 24\/7 call center through voice activation, and it automatically monitors the air quality, motion and room temperature.  Like other home-based systems, Aloe Care has a base unit and a wearable help button, and it uses 4G cellular coverage only (no landlines). But unlike other brands, you don't have to switch to another device if you want on-the-go coverage as well. You can just opt for the Essentials Plus or Total Care packages, which come with a mobile device that can go anywhere, yet is still compatible with your regular home unit. (That mobile device also comes with free fall detection.)   Aloe Care's caregiver app is one of the best around, according to reviewers. It allows your loved ones to check in directly with you and collaborate on your care. Add in other small, but important perks -- like a free lockbox for your home valuables, and the ability to amplify sound for the hearing impaired -- and this is a great all-in-one medical alert for those that can afford it.

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Apple Watch Series 7 with an A smartwatch with medical alert features: Starting at $399 discount","completion":" The  Apple Watch  is technically a regular smartwatch, not a medical alert device. But with new features like  fall detection , it's starting to blur the line between the two. The watch automatically pings you if it detects a fall, then contacts emergency services and alerts designated contacts if it doesn't detect any movement within 60 seconds. You can also call 911 with your Apple Watch by using Siri or holding down the side button until the Emergency SOS slider appears. Its battery life is similar to Bay Alarm's SOS Smartwatch, at around 18 hours.  However, the Apple Watch doesn't come with live emergency monitoring, nor does it have the caregiver features that come with a traditional medical alert. Also, if you want to use the watch to send messages and make calls even when your iPhone is out of reach, you'll have to pay extra for monthly cellular service (using the same provider as your phone). You can expect to pay about $10 extra per month, depending on your provider.  If you don't need 24\/7 emergency support and have other good reasons to use an Apple Watch, like its robust health and activity-tracking capabilities, then this may be a viable option.  "}

This offer is technically for an original PS Plus subscription from before the revamp, which will automatically convert to an Essential membership. We haven't had a chance to test this deal ourselves, but several reviewers have stated that they've had no problem redeeming one of these older codes. An Essential membership is typically $60 for the year, which is already a 50% discount on the monthly plan pricing. But right now at CD Keys, you can get an annual subscription for $50, which drops the monthly cost to just over $4.

Farmer's Fridge also sells grain bowls, pasta entrees, wraps and breakfast parfaits but I suggest the salads. I had the chicken Caesar, Cobb and harvest salad and all three tasted fresh and portions were more substantial. If you work from home and miss those simple salad runs to Chop't or Au Bon Pain, this service will scratch the itch and keep you well fed throughout the week.

{"prompt":"Make a description about an U-Turn Orbit Theory with an Best turntable under $1,000 discount","completion":" The Orbit Theory may look similar to the original Orbit Plus, but this is a vastly superior turntable. Seemingly every component has been upgraded -- from a hardwood plinth to a solid magnesium tonearm -- and of course, U-Turn charges handsomely for these improvements at $999.   The record player is assembled in the US, while the new arm tube is also manufactured here, and the Orbit incorporates almost every \"must have\" feature (save for automatic operation). The model has adjustable feet, speed control, a nifty tonearm lift and almost everything is preinstalled at the factory. While the package also comes with a felt mat, I found it sounded better without. Placing the record directly on the acrylic platter is also hella cool.  I listened to the Orbit Theory against my reference Rega Planar 3 with a Goldring E3 cartridge, and the Orbit performed surprisingly well. Sound quality was helped enormously by the Ortofon 2M Blue which exhibited the same sound signature I'd heard before on the Fluance RT-85 and the Project Debut Pro. Only here, with the Orbit Theory, the brightness was better kept in check. Bass was deep and tight, the midrange expressive and detailed, while there was still that treble forwardness that people often associate with digital. The model I received had the optional (and defeatable) $70 phono amp onboard. If you don't have a preamp of your own, it sounds pretty good, though upgrading will pay dividends with better bass.  While the Orbit Plus was a fairly average model for the money, I was impressed with the newest product. So impressed that the supercharged Orbit Theory is now my favorite turntable under $1,000.  "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an Rega Planar 3 \/w Ortofon 2M Blue with an Best over $1,000 discount","completion":" Rega has made turntables for over 40 years, and was the first to develop the lightweight plinth (or base) that's now seen in most modern turntables. Even at $1,125 or more, the Planar 3 sits just in the middle of the company's range, but it's arguably the best value. It's also a thing of elegance, with a simple-to-set-up design and the beautiful RB330 tonearm (if you're into that sort of thing). If you're a tweaker you can customize almost every part with a wide selection of third-party upgrades. With the right cartridge the Rega Planar 3 offers an exciting, fun sound, while also looking great and just being a complete blast to use. It is highly recommended.   Note that the Rega comes in a number of different configurations, such as without a cartridge ($1,125), with the Ortofon 2M ($1,364) or with the Rega Elys ($1,395). If you get the bare table you can choose whichever cartridge you want, and a good dealer will fix one without charging installation fees. "}

Still, I always find myself coming back to Tone and Sculpt.   This app allows you to customize your fitness plan to the point that it seems like the program was personalized for you. You get to choose the  trainer  of your liking from women with different specialties like  strength training , endurance, barre and yoga. You can also select the number of workout sessions you want to accomplish every week (three or five times per week), the level you are most comfortable with (beginner, intermediate, advanced and expert), equipment (you can also select if you will be working out from home or in a gym) and, lastly, nutrition preference. Depending on the program you select, you can expect the duration to be anywhere from eight weeks (yoga) to 67 weeks (strength training).  Once you've selected the  program  that best fits your goals and lifestyle, you'll see your dashboard, where you can find your weekly planner showing the workout routines by days of the week. You can change the order of the workouts in your planner and add any workouts or challenges from the workout library. Short videos and descriptions accompany each exercise to help you do it correctly.   One of my favorite features of this app is the meal planner. You can choose from four different diet types: standard (best for omnivores), vegetarian, vegan and pescatarian. With the meal planner, you can input your own meals to track what you eat in a day, or you can ask the app to do it for you. If you let the app plan your meals, it will give you a shopping list and recipes for your meals. Most of these recipes are simple and easy to follow and they usually take 15 to 20 minutes to prep.

Once I was left without a gym to attend, I thought that it was a good time to subscribe to her app since I enjoyed her classes and her inspiring content so much. I subscribed to the  seven-day free trial  and decided to keep my membership because of how good the workouts made me feel.  The MWH Method aims to help you sculpt long, lean lines by practicing controlled, low-impact movements. At the beginning of each practice, you're prompted to set an intention for your workout. The idea behind the method is to work toward a stronger body and build a better relationship with yourself.    This app has an extensive selection of workouts to choose from, and every Monday a new workout is uploaded. Most of the MWH Method videos are 10 to 30 minutes long and combine low-impact Pilates and yoga movements. Don't be fooled by the \"low-impact\" wording -- that does not mean easy or low-effort. The subtle movements and prolonged repetition will have your muscles burning. She also occasionally mixes in dance movements as part of the warmups to get you in the mood for working out. In addition to the regular workouts, the program offers guided meditations, pre- and post-natal exercises and beginner workouts.       Pros :   Workout library is highly organized  Inclusive routines for all body types and levels of experience  Short workouts that you can bundle to create your own routine    Cons:    No long-term program to follow  No tools for tracking progress  "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an Best for holistic health: StrongHer with an $14.99 per month \/ $38.99 per quarter \/ $89.99 per year discount","completion":"  App Store rating :  4.7 out of 5    Google Play rating :  4.7 out of 5   StrongHer was created by  Melissa Chalmers  when she began a fitness journey for her wedding. As she started seeing results and the benefits of leading a healthy lifestyle, she decided to share what she had learned with the rest of the world. This fitness and nutrition program aims to provide a personal trainer that you can take anywhere with you through an app. What I like about the app is that you get personal training and fully customizable nutrition plans tied to your goals. The nutrition plan is just that, a plan with meals you can create with the recipes they provide (no meals will be delivered to your home).  When you download the app, the first thing you'll do is set your objectives -- it could be to lose weight, tone your muscles or build muscle mass. Then you'll be asked about whether you'll be working out at home or at a gym and the type of workouts you enjoy most, followed by a series of questions about things like height, weight and lifestyle.   You can customize your nutrition plan to your liking, choosing from a standard diet (no allergies or restrictions), keto or vegetarian. To all my fellow vegans, worry not. Even though there isn't an official vegan option, if you select the vegetarian option, you can exclude foods like honey, milk and eggs to make your plan vegan-friendly. Similarly to Weight Watchers, StrongHer has a point system for the foods in your nutrition plan. Every food is assigned a number of points based on its calories, fat and protein. The number of points you have in your daily budget will depend on your personalized nutrition plan.   What sets this workout app apart from the rest is the ability to track your progress through time. For example, suppose you started with 5-pound weights for bicep curls, and in two months you are able to lift 10 pounds. If you document it in the app, it'll show you historical data about your physical activity progress, calorie intake and water intake.  As for the workouts, I found them to be fun and you can make them as challenging as you want. The app will not recommend the amount of weight to use; instead, you decide what feels right or challenging enough for you. There is a quick outline and a short video demonstration for each exercise in case the movement is new to you or you wish to have more guidance on your form.   Pros :   New workouts added to the library every week   Ability to track progress over time   Personalized meal plans     Cons :   Aggressive ads to upgrade membership   Users on the App Store have reported  slow customer service  response  "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an Best for yoga: Alo Moves with an $20 per month or $199 per year (14-day free trial) discount","completion":"  App Store rating :  4.9 out of 5    Google Play rating :  4.3 out of 5    Alo Moves  is a  yoga  app from parent company  Alo Yoga  -- yes, the trendy brand responsible for getting us all hooked on the famous  Alo Yoga Goddess Leggings . The app essentially connects you with yoga instructors through an extensive array of classes.  What I like most about this app is that it's not limited to only yoga classes. With your membership, you get access to four different workout categories:  fitness  (Barre, HIIT, Core, Pilates, Stretching and Stretch),  yoga  (ashtanga, vinyasa, kundalini, hatha, restorative and prenatal),  mindfulness  (breathwork, meditation, personal growth and sound bath) and  skills  (focuses on inversions, mobility, poses and flexibility).   As with many other fitness apps, you'll be asked several questions about your skill level, goals and preferred workout methods upon signing up for Alo Moves. This will narrow down the app's recommended classes for your specific goals. Most classes range from 20 to 60 minutes long and you can choose from over 70 instructors. Something I found particularly interesting about this app is how it suggests classes you should take based on your answers and classes you've taken. Think of it like how  Netflix  recommends watching certain shows or movies based on what you previously watched.  One thing that stands out from this app is the instructors' energy and how it varies from one class to another. Most of my instructors from the restorative yoga series had such a calming and soothing presence that I made taking a yoga class part of my morning routine. On the other hand, the teachers from the kundalini or vinyasa classes radiate so much energy that you finish the class ready to take on the day. It's safe to say that there is a class for every type of mood. I should point out that for the most part instructors will describe the poses, but others assume that you know the pose they call out. This might make classes challenging to follow for beginners. Taking classes with Alo Moves is comparable to taking a class in a studio, with the flexibility of going at your own pace.   Pros :   Class recommendations tailored to you   Extensive workout library     Cons :   More expensive than most workout subscription services   Beginners might not find the classes descriptive enough  "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an Best for experienced trainers: Sweat with an $19.99 a month (with a seven-day free trial) or $119.94 a year discount","completion":"  App Store rating :  4.6 out of 5    Google Play rating :  4.3 out of 5   The  Sweat  App was founded by  Kayla Itsines , an Australian fitness guru who gained popularity on social media with her High Intensity with Kayla (formerly known as BBG) e-books back in 2015. Since then, the fitness program has evolved from digital book to fitness app, raking up over  1 million users  every month.  It's not hard to see why this workout app is a fan favorite; it offers over  30 programs  -- all designed to fit multiple workout preferences and achieve different results. Some of the most notable plans include at-home workouts, gym training plans, post-pregnancy programs and zero-equipment workouts. Even when you finish a program, there are so many other options to explore that it's doubtful you'll ever get bored with a routine. And like any other well-designed fitness app, Sweat strives to provide you with a personal trainer 24\/7 right in the palm of your hand, along with a nutrition plan to help you reach your goals.  Before beginning your workout, you can set up your playlist (through Spotify or Apple Music) and select the equipment you have available. Based on your equipment selection, the app will recommend a routine that you can follow. I found this particularly helpful since most workout apps have fixed routines, and often you don't have the right equipment to complete them. Every exercise is paired with a video and description if you're unsure how to execute specific movements.    I think this app is best for experienced trainers because of how challenging the  PWR program is . PWR focuses on muscle growth and body strength through hypertrophy, which is essentially an increase in muscle size that is achieved through progressive weight lifting. The workouts range from 45 to 60 minutes long and are meant to be performed in a gym. If you're into strength training but don't have access to a gym, you can opt for the  PWR At Home  program.   The nutrition plan is pretty on par with what other workout apps offer. It plans out your meals for the week and has recipes that you can follow to create at home. Sweat takes the planning out of your workouts and nutrition. Overall, the app is straightforward and really user-friendly.    Pros :   Spotify and Apple music integrated into the app   Ability to customize your weekly workout plan   Each exercise has an alternative exercise if the one suggested is too challenging     Cons :   Pricier than other apps with similar features   Exercises are pretty repetitive throughout the workouts  "}

Atlas VPN's server fleet is currently stated to be around 700 across 28 countries, which is smaller than those of the major VPN providers.

As of right now, Samsung is offering instant rebates of up to $150 on the S22 and S22 Plus, or up to $200 on the S22 Ultra. And you can save even more with a qualifying trade-in. Samsung's site claims that you can earn up to $280 in trade-in credit, but the latest iPhones will net you as much as $845 off, and newer Samsung phones will net you as much as $335 off.

All three models are currently available, though you'll find select colors and configurations that are out of stock at the moment.  "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an AT&T with an Save up to $800 with trade-in discount","completion":" This time around, AT T is getting far more aggressive with its trade-in offers on the Galaxy S22 devices. The carrier is matching Verizon's offer from last year and is accepting select phones in  any condition  as a trade-in. If you have an old phone worth at least $35, AT T will give you up to $800 in enhanced trade-in credit, even if your trade-in is broken or doesn't turn on.  With this promotion, you can get the base Galaxy S22 for free, get the S22 Plus for as little as $5.56 per month or the S22 Ultra for just over $11 per month. The credits take place over a 36-month period, and if you cancel service before the 36 months is over you'll have to pay the remaining balance.

At the moment, AT T is sold out of all configurations of the S22 Plus, as well as several S22 and S22 Ultra configurations.

Those upgrading an existing line can get up to $800 off on all three models, which still nets you the base model S22 for free. And new customers switching a line over from another carrier will also get a $200 Verizon gift card.  You can even trade in broken or damaged phones, as long as the battery is intact, which is something that the carrier started doing last year. That means that you can get the S22 for free, and the S22 Ultra for less than $6 per month. The discount will be applied via monthly bill credits, so you can't get this offer when you purchase the phone outright. It's also worth noting that Verizon is now using 36-month terms instead of 24-month terms, so you'll want to make sure that works for you before placing your order.  Verizon is offering some other bonuses as well, including a free Galaxy Watch 5 and $490 off a Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE.

If you don't have a device to trade in, all carriers are also offering a discount with a new line of service.   If you prefer an unlocked model, Best Buy is also offering $200 off the S22 Plus and Ultra, or $150 of the base model S22. The site claims you'll have to choose same-day activation to get the discount (essentially defeating the point of an unlocked phone), but you can get the same price when you select activate later. Best Buy also has its own trade-in program where you can save even more.  "}

For whatever reason, those proportions worked exceptionally well for us and this chef's knife really feels like an extension of my hand when I'm using it. It has a fairly linear, rounded handle but one I find quite comfortable.   The knife also has excellent balance and feels somewhere between the German and Japanese styles. The blade is forged from a composition of steel known as X50CrMoV15, which is high in chromium, making it both strong and highly resistant to corrosion. I really loved using this quality knife and think it offers some good value for the price. "}

While some out there still chose to purchase a PlayStations 5 Disc Edition or an Xbox Series X over the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition or Xbox Series S due to the formers' inclusion of a physical disc drive, many feel it's just no longer necessary.   Remember when a popular game would sell out at launch and you'd have to wait weeks or months to join your friends in playing it because you couldn't track down a physical copy? No one misses that. But, we still need a place to keep all of the infinitely available games we can now download, on-demand, to our favorite consoles.

You can choose from either a P10 drive designed specifically to work with Xbox's proprietary hardware, or a USB 3.2 drive compatible with Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Mac. Either way, you'll be saving a huge amount off of the drives.

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Allswell mattress with an Best mattress for stomach sleepers under $500 discount","completion":" Stomach sleepers looking for max savings should consider the very affordable Allswell mattress, brought to you by retail giant Walmart. They entered the bed-in-a-box game to compete with budget brands and they have made one of the most affordable hybrid mattresses on the market. At the same time, it doesn't feel like a cheap mattress. It's a quality firm mattress that gets the job done at a low cost.   The Allswell mattress is three layers thick with a pocketed coil base layer, transition foam and almost an inch of gel memory foam sandwiched underneath the cover. It's a simple mattress with a slighter firmer profile. I'd rate it around a six or seven out of 10 on the firmness scale, somewhere around a medium to medium-firm.   You sleep more on top of the bed rather than inside, a plus for stomach or back sleepers looking for a supportive sleeping surface. It's a responsive mattress with comfortable foam that bounces back quickly to pressure, making it easy to switch positions on. It reminds me of a traditional innerspring bed, with the added cushion of foam layers.   Of course, one of the best parts about this mattress is its price. You can buy the Allswell directly from the Allswell Home website, but it usually runs for cheaper if you buy one from Walmart where a queen-size model goes for around $350.

I  spotlighted the CR-10 Mini back in 2018 , and I found it to make very nice prints. It's still a workhorse in the Fab Lab to this day.  But if you don't need the added build area, I'd recommend you go with the Ender 3 Pro. It's a newer and better overall machine. One note: The CR-10 line tends to drop in and out of stock.

It's the fastest, fanciest Eero system to date, and one that performed quite well  when I put it through multiple rounds of tests . Plus, it supports speeds faster than a gigabit thanks to a multi-gig Ethernet WAN port, a nice piece of future-proofing.  Even at full price, I already recommend the Eero Pro 6E as an upgrade pick for homes that want to take advantage of fast, gigabit-level internet connections -- now, for Prime Day, Amazon has multiple Eero Pro 6E setups listed for hundreds off. Larger, multi-story homes might want to consider stepping up to the three-pack, which usually costs $699 but is  currently on sale for $419  -- but I think that the two-pack would be more than enough for most homes (and you can always add another device later if you need it).

Now, those same deals have been rebranded as Cyber Monday specials.  Among all of them, I'd recommend the two-piece Eero Pro 6E system at its $299 discount price. For the money, you're getting a high-speed mesh system that supports connections over the ultrawide 6GHz band, thanks to  Wi-Fi 6E  support. Speeds were strong in our tests, as was the system's range, so the two-pack should be enough coverage for most homes (and you can always add a third device later on if needed). At $299, it's priced the same as a two-piece Nest Wifi Pro system, and the Eero Pro 6E  outperformed that system  by a notable margin in our tests. That, plus strong smart home chops via the built-in Zigbee radio and Thread support, make the Eero Pro 6E an easy router to recommend. "}

As it turns out, this Yamaha offers even better build quality and a huge cinematic sound.  Look through the fancy top grille and you'll see neatly packed components and a distinguished, stamped transformer. The system is capable of a beefy 110 watts per channel (stereo) and has seven HDMI ports for your connectivity needs.  I tested the Yamaha A4A against the Onkyo RZ50 and the Denon X3700. The Yamaha's sound quality tended toward the cinematic rather than the musical and offered a big, roomy sound perfect for blockbusters or  moody conspiracy thrillers . What was surprising is that the onboard phono preamp was even better than the one on the rival Onkyo RZ50, so I can recommend it for people who don't want a separate preamp for their turntable.  The Yamaha is great with movies but doesn't sound as good with music streaming. Still, as the Onkyo offers balanced performance across both, it's my current favorite. "}

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Tribit XSound Mega: $55 with an Save $75 discount","completion":" Over the last few years, Tribit has made several Bluetooth speakers that deliver a lot of boom for the buck. Add its new XSound Mega to the list.  Tribit is billing the XSound Mega as more of an outdoor speaker -- a lanyard is included for toting it around as a sort of mini boombox -- but it works just fine indoors. It has an LED light show that you can turn on or off and there are three EQ settings for sound: XBass, Music and Audiobook. Additionally, it can be used as a power bank to charge your mobile devices.  In my tests, the speaker compared pretty favorably to more expensive speakers like the JBL Charge 5. There's plenty of bass and the speaker plays loud for its size, with decent clarity. That said, it's a mono speaker with a single driver and two bass radiators -- that's how you get all that bass. So while you can expect big sound, the soundstage doesn't feel all that wide, particularly at lower volumes. It actually sounds better at higher volumes. "}

They're also comfortable to wear and have both active noise canceling and transparency mode. However, the noise canceling is only OK, not great (same goes for the transparency mode). But you can't expect everything for such a low price.  Equipped with Bluetooth 5.2, they're IPX4 splash-proof and have a battery-life rating of up to 5.5 hours on a single charge at moderate volume levels.   They have relatively smooth, balanced sound and ample bass. They're not going to wow you with clarity or dynamic sound, but they're pleasant to listen to, which is all you can ask for in a budget set of earbuds.   Callers said that my voice sounded clearer when I was using the AirPods Pro but the Soundpeats actually reduced more background noise that the AirPods Pro.

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Wyze Noise-Cancelling Headphones with an All-around solid for around $80 discount","completion":" Founded by four former Amazon employees, Wyze is known for its value security cams but it's now doing a nice job with value headphones. Its over-ear noise canceling headphones offer a comfortable fit with deep memory foam ear pads and solid all-around performance. Their noise canceling is quite good, although you do get some added passive noise isolation from the tight seal the ear pads give you (your ears will get pretty steamy in warmer weather). These are Alexa-enabled, so all you have to do is press a button to access Amazon's voice assistant, or you can use your phone's native voice assistant if you prefer. There's also a transparency mode that lets ambient sound in.   As for sound quality, these are on the warmer side -- they have lots of bass and a pretty open soundstage, though they lack that extra clarity and definition you get from higher-end models (the bass is a touch loose). In other words, the sound is quite good for the money but not ridiculously good.   Battery life is rated at up to 20 hours at moderate volume levels and I thought the headset performance was decent as well. A cloth carrying pouch is included along with a USB-C charging cable and a cord for using these as wired headphones. "}

Its G Pro X Wireless model has been at the top of that lineup for a couple of years now, but it's still yet to be beaten by any other entry from Logitech itself and can stand toe-to-toe with the best from Razer and even some high-end, audiophile-grade headphones.  The model's understated design, detachable microphone, and tank-like build quality mean you can feel confident tossing it into a bag to bring to a LAN party or friend's house. The lack of RGB lighting also provides 20 hours of continuous runtime. While this may not stand up to some newer entries, few of those can provide the same level of sound quality as the G Pro X's huge 50mm drivers.  This rare discount drops the price of one of the best wireless headsets from one of the most trusted manufacturers out there very close to its lowest ever.  "}

Essentially, it is an $899 waterproof handheld camera\/drone. It looks like an egg. You can hold. It has a little side handle on it. I was watching the promotional video, but it has a three-axis gimbal, so it's stabilized video or you could fly it up in the air. It has facial recognition, it'll follow.

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Best for travel with an Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey Single-Serve Packets discount","completion":"  Servings per container:  6 single-serve packets   Grams of protein per serving:  24    Why I chose it:  It's not the best protein brand out there, but it's the best well-rounded whey protein that comes in single-serve packets.   Traveling with protein powder can get annoying. Bulky tubs and crinkly mylar bags aren't exactly easy to pack, and scooping out servings into baggies for each day of your trip gets tedious (and wasteful if you don't reuse the plastic bags). Single-serve protein powder packets are an easy solution, although still not as environmentally friendly as buying in bulk.   Surprisingly, I didn't come across a great selection of single-serve protein packets in my search. None of the top picks on this list offer single-serve packets, or else one of them would be in this place.   Optimum Nutrition, however, is a long-standing brand with a good reputation. Most major vitamin and supplement stores stock it, including GNC, The Vitamin Shoppe, and Vitamin World. I used Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard whey protein for several years and never had any issues with it. The flavors taste good, the powder mixes decently and the macronutrient ratio is good (only 3 grams of carbs to the 24 grams of protein).   Some protein powder purists have qualms with Optimum Nutrition for mixing whey protein isolates, concentrate, and peptides, as well as using the artificial sweetener acesulfame potassium, but those are nonproblems for the average person.   In any case, this is a solid, no-frills whey protein you can buy in convenient travel-friendly packets.  "}

{"prompt":"Make a description about an FLYBIRD Weight Bench with an Save $70 discount","completion":"   Current price: $169.79    Original price: $239.99    I tend to be hesitant to recommend weight benches, just because they can take up so much space. But nothing beats the \"I'm working out\" vibe that a weight bench provides, plus they're ideal for making sure you keep proper form.   Proper form means how you place your body and muscles to make sure they get the proper burn, but also keep safe and supported. Weight benches are powerful tools for keeping that form.  This is also a great time to take advantage of that Amazon Prime membership. Weight benches (like the weights themselves) weigh a lot, and therefore cost a ton to ship. But as a Prime member, that shipping cost is all absorbed by Amazon and you pay nothing to bring the bench to your door. "}

It has an average weight for a 10-inch frying pan (3 pounds) and is oven-safe up to 450 degrees F.   One thing to note about the Calphalon is the nearly vertical sides where other pans have more of a gentle slope. The straight sides, not unlike a sauté pan, make it easier to keep wet or saucy contents inside the pan but a bit more difficult to slide food out and onto a platter.  "}

We typically see Apple keep prices the same, or increase them, each year, but with the iPhone 11, we actually saw a price drop of $50 at launch and further drops since the iPhone 13 release.   Unlike the terrible decision to launch the iPhone 11 Pro\/Pro Max with 64GB and then charge a massive premium to upgrade to the next level of 256GB, Apple lets iPhone 11 buyers go from 64GB to 128GB for just $50. Thus, the iPhone 11 with 128GB is an excellent and recommended option for most people.   The iPhone 11 has a size between the 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max with long battery life, capable processor, several color options, and rear dual camera setup.

Now, through July 17, it's down even lower, to $120. That's a total of $60 off of the retail price, and one of the best prices we've seen it listed at all year.  For the money, you're getting a sophisticated smart doorbell with an attractive design, multiple color options, two-way talk, high-def resolution, a 145-degree field of view with a 3:4 aspect ratio, smart alerts, and more. During our tests, we were particularly impressed with the low latency of the video feed, which helps keeps the conversation snappy during two-way talk. You'll need to pay $6 a month for a Nest Aware subscription if you want to unlock facial recognition and a full 30 days of video storage, but you can skip that and still enjoy person detection, vehicle-, package- or animal-specific notifications, and up to three hours of free video storage.  As a Google device, the Nest Doorbell is best suited for smart homes centered around other Nest gadgets and the Google Assistant. For instance, you can sync your  Nest speakers  with the doorbell to sound the chime whenever someone's at the door, or call up the doorbell's video feed on your  Nest Hub smart displays . The Nest Doorbell doesn't offer native support for Apple HomeKit, but it does work with Alexa, so Amazon-powered smart homes can connect the doorbell with their Echo smart speakers and smart displays, too.

Depending on where you live, Amazon will deliver the mouse as soon as tomorrow via One-Day Prime shipping.   I've personally been using the MX Master 3 since the start of the pandemic. As someone who works remotely and clicks, glides, and scrolls for 8+ hours a day, it does more than I could ask for. The ergonomic design of the mouse provides a very comfortable grip, with a hump that eases the pressure when you lay your palm down. As a result, I've been able to use this mouse without needing a cushion pad to relieve any wrist pain.   There are numerous programmable buttons scattered throughout the mouse, including one on the thumb rest, and you can also register gesture commands via Logitech's software. The mouse has a sensor resolution of 4,000 DPI and Logitech's Darkfield technology, which allows the tracking sensor to work on virtually any surface. These features, along with Logitech's multi-computer cursor movement, Flow, make the MX Master 3 a productivity king.   On the battery front, the MX Master 3 supports USB-C quick charging, and Logitech promises up to 70 days of usage before needing to top it off again.

Turtle Beach says this Gen 2 model has improved 50mm Nanoclear drivers -- the sound is more detailed and \"precise\" -- there's a redesigned metal-reinforced headband and a larger, high-sensitivity flip-to-mute mic. Its engineers tuned it to deliver even \"more detailed and precise  sound.\" I thought it sounded quite good, and the headset pairs to your phone and is also good for music listening and taking calls while you're gaming. There's an \"all-new\" Turtle Beach Hub app for iOS and Android that allows you to tweak the audio and remap buttons.   This headset will work with older Xbox One consoles as well as the next-gen Series consoles. Battery life is now up to 20 hours -- the headset charges via USB-C -- and thanks to Xbox Wireless technology, you can connect wirelessly to the Xbox without using a dongle like you have to do with the PS4.   If you're looking at this versus the step-down Stealth 600 Gen 2, which retails for $100, that model is also good but the Stealth 700 Gen definitely has a more premium feel to it. It's really a good Xbox wireless headset for around $160.  "}

It appears users either love it or hate it, which may go to the cost controls necessary to reach that price point with dual filament functionality. That said, I prefer dual filament machines, and if you're willing to take a slight risk (Amazon does allow returns), it's a worthwhile and powerful option.

There are a lot of under-$200 3D printers on the market now. But cheap doesn't necessarily mean safe.

{"prompt":"Make a description about an It takes Two for PlayStation 4 with an Save $20 discount","completion":"   Current price: $20    Original price: $40    It Takes Two was something of a surprise hit. It's an action-adventure game from a smaller studio with the somewhat unique mechanic of requiring two players to complete. At a time when most major hits tend to be AAA titles from bigger studios, It Takes Two garnered a cult following through the comedic, often disastrous, attempts of many streamers to collaborate with a friend to overcome the game's challenges.  That requirement for collaboration means the game can be a blast to play whether you win or lose, even if that enjoyment just comes from ribbing each other about terrible timing or unbelievably bad coordination. The game's rating of \"T - for Teen\" means all but the youngest family members can get in on the action as well.   Perhaps best of all from a deals perspective, is the fact that only one of the two players needs to actually own the game, even for online co-op. This means you could technically even split the $20 cost with a friend bringing it down to $10 for each of you.  "}

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Anker Soundcore Life P2 with an Under $50 Anker discount","completion":" Anker has released its newer  Soundcore Life P3  (around $70), but the Soundcore Life P2 earbuds remain a good value option at around $45. The buds charge horizontally in their case rather than vertically, and there's a slightly cheaper feel to both the case and the buds compared with the Liberty Air 2. Their sound doesn't have the presence boost in the treble that the Liberty Air 2 buds have, so they're not as clear-sounding with well-recorded tracks, and the bass isn't quite as well defined. But they're warmer and more forgiving, which I appreciated, and they sound more like the original Liberty Air.  It's also worth noting that instead of touch controls they feature physical buttons, which some people may prefer. They have four microphones, two of which are supposed to help with noise reduction when making calls in noisier environments. They do a decent job of reducing background noise when making calls, but my voice didn't sound as clear to callers as it did with Anker's Liberty Air 2.  While there's no wireless charging, you do get USB-C charging. Battery life is rated at seven hours, and this true wireless earbud option has an IPX7 water-resistance rating, which means they can be fully submerged in water to a depth of 3 feet and still survive. They're arguably the best value in the Anker true wireless line right now. An almost identical version to these earbuds is sold at Target under the name Soundcore Life Note.  I should also mention that Anker is now selling the smaller  Soundcore Life P2 Mini , which has shorter stems. It's also good for the money but this model has four microphones for voice calling while that model has two. The Life P3 has six microphones.  "}

Although OnePlus first few generations stuck exclusively to  the concept of making smartphones that could compete with big-name  flagships at mid-range prices, the company's more recent offerings have  grown well into the \"premium smartphone\" price range. It's latest  flagship, the OnePlus 10 Pro, continued this trend by launching at $899.  Although  the OnePlus 10 Pro's current price puts it out of this list's purview, the  N200 5G comes reasonably close to its hardware specs with the same  screen size and resolution (albeit at a lower 90Hz refresh rate), a  Qualcomm Snapdragon Series chipset, and a very similar front-facing  camera. Some concessions are, of course, included in the lower  resolution main rear shooter and the halved RAM and internal storage  specs. However, when considering that you could buy a three of these,  with some change left over, for the same price as the OnePlus 10 Pro, those  moderate downgrades might start mattering a lot less.

Noise canceling and call quality are also quite decent. They list for $200, which is pretty expensive, but they're on sale for $100 for a limited time.   They made CNET's  best-sounding wireless earbuds list  and their main drawback is that, like some other buds on that list, they're somewhat bulbous and do stick out of your ears a bit (alas, better sounding earbuds tend to be larger). But I found them pretty comfortable and got a secure fit with the largest ear tips. They're IPX4 splash-resistant and have a battery life rating of six hours with noise canceling on and eight hours with it off, at moderate volume levels. They offer pretty solid voice-calling performance, though it's not quite up to the level of the AirPods Pro.   At $200, it's hard for them to compete against such models as the AirPods Pro and the new Beats Fit Pro, particularly if you're an iPhone user. But they're certainly more enticing at $100.  "}

{"prompt":"Make a description about an TCL 55-inch 6-Series Mini LED Smart TV with an Save $50 discount","completion":" During Cyber Monday, you'll see retailers slashing prices on TVs, with some  pretty great deals out there , but as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for. The price may be appealing, but it might not be the high-quality TV you want.  And that's where the  TCL 6-Series Mini LED Smart TV  comes in. I won't say much about it, and instead let you read what CNET's own David Katzmaier says about it. \"This TV has an excellent image thanks to  mini-LED tech  and well-implemented  full-array local dimming  that helps it run circles around just about any other TV at this price. Over the  last   five   years  the TCL 6-Series has earned its place as the  best TV  for the money by combining excellent image quality with a price most TV shoppers can afford.\" "}

Mpow seems to be regularly tweaking its earphones, and the X3 earbuds were briefly taken off Amazon, before returning with an update. \"The new version upgraded the volume control and optimized its active noise-canceling function and call effect,\" the company told me. \"It also added the supersoft ear caps, which [are] more comfortable to wear for a long time.\"  They did fit me comfortably and securely and I got a tight seal from one of the sets of XL ear tips. They're fully waterproof (IPX7) and get up to 7 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels with USB-C charging. (The charging case looks like a fat version of the standard AirPods case.) Call quality is good -- they have a sidetone feature that lets you hear your voice in the earbuds -- but I've used other earbuds with better noise reduction during calls. I noticed a touch of audio lag when I streamed a YouTube video but no problems when streaming iTunes movies.  The touch controls take some getting used to -- they're a little wonky -- and it didn't help that the instructions in the box seemed to be for the old X3 model. I found the  current instructions online , which helped me figure things out. Aside from a few minor downsides, Mpow's X3 earbuds are a great value.  "}

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Pro-Ject Debut Pro with an Runner-up under $1,000 discount","completion":" Entry-level turntables are great for people getting into the vinyl hobby, but if you really want to unlock the sound quality encased in your records it's well worth upgrading. The Pro-Ject Debut Pro is a high-quality record player offering many usability features the competitive  Rega Planar 3  doesn't.  For instance, the Sumiko Rainier cartridge comes preinstalled, and the combination of adjustable feet and electronic speed change are a godsend for user-friendliness. The only tip I would give a potential buyer of this turntable is to buy a  stylus force gauge  as the \"plastic see-saw\" in the box is finicky to set the tracking weight correctly.   Once setup is complete, though, the sound the Pro produces simply astonishes. If you've ever heard of vinyl described as \"warm\", then this is definitely not that. When paired with a decent system, a high-quality turntable like the Pro-Ject should sound as good as, if not better, than the equivalent digital file. Through testing, I found the Debut Pro has a way of making even well-worn records sound hi-fi with plenty of high-end detail, an expressive midrange and surprisingly deep bass. If your music needs some pep -- if your records make you sleep rather than dance -- this player is a great way to energize your system. The downside to the Pro-Ject's enthusiastic presentation is that with the \"wrong\" record, the sound could become a little fatiguing.  When you pair \"true hi-fi\" performance with day-to-day ease of use and drop-dead good looks I can't think of another turntable apart from the Orbit Theory that can hold a candle to it. That said, it is also worth looking at the pared-back Rega Planar 3, as it offers a touch more sonic subtlety and one of the best tonearms out there. "}

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Creative Sound Blaster Jam V2 with an Best under $50 discount","completion":" I was a fan of Creative's  original Sound Blaster Jam  headphones that came out in 2015 and had a decidedly retro look and feel with good sound for the money. Now the headphone is available in a 2.0 version that has some key upgrades, including Bluetooth 5.0, USB-C charging, improved call quality and multipoint Bluetooth pairing that allows you to pair it to two devices simultaneously. Battery life is rated at up to 22 hours.  I was able to pair the headphones with a Mac Mini and an iPhone 12 Pro and then switch audio between them. Often when pairing Bluetooth headphones with Mac and Windows PCs, one can encounter some issues, but once I got the headphones paired with both my PC and phone, they made a good pair of work-from-home headphones. Also, the price is right for parents looking for a decent set of kids' headphones for remote learning and everyday use.  Comfortable for on-ear headphones, the Jam V2 are lightweight and have nicely balanced sound with good detail and bass that's ample but not overpowering. Call quality was good in my tests with callers saying they could hear me well even on the noisy streets of New York. No carry pouch is included, but you do get an extra set of foam ear pads, which is good because they will wear out over time.  The headphones have physical buttons for controlling volume and playback and there's AptX support for devices that support the wireless streaming codec.  "}

{"prompt":"Make a description about an EIBOS 3D Filament Dryer CYCLOPES with an Filament dryer | $152 discount","completion":" Since this is an affordable 3D printer article, we wanted to address one of the biggest cost items: the cost of filament. While you can get a 1kg roll of filament for as little as $18 or so, you can also find yourself spending $40, $60, or even $80 for a roll of a specialty filament. The problem is that filament is hydroscopic -- it absorbs water in the air. Filament that's not completely dry can clog your printer, leave artefacts on your print, and simply fail.  And sure, you can toss older, opened filament out when it gets too damp, but we recommend using a filament dryer like the EIBOS CYCLOPES. Just put a couple of rolls in the machine, turn it on, and it sucks out the dampness from your filament, often restoring the filament to new in a short time. It pays for itself if you can recover five or six rolls of otherwise useless filament.  Oh, and one more thing. You  must  watch the original  EIBOS Kickstarter Video . Go. Do it now. Trust us when we tell you that Morgan the Cat steals the show. You can't make this stuff up.   Pros:    Can revive old filament  Ease of use  That Kickstarter video    Cons:    Not all filament rolls can be saved  Relatively large footprint   "}

I found that headset performance for voice calls is decent, but not quite up to the level of the AirPods Pro. The charging case does offer wireless charging.    These are slightly more geared toward Android users -- TCL makes budget Android phones, after all -- and feature Google Fast Pair. That said, they work fine with iPhones and TCL's companion app is available for iOS and Android (you can customize the sound and touch controls in the app). The earbuds support the AAC audio codec, but not aptX.   These automatically pause your music when you pull the earbuds out of your ears and they're IP54 splash- and dust-proof. The stems are a little long, but the earbuds fit me comfortably and I got a tight seal using the largest ear tips. The S600 is available in three color options. "}

{"prompt":"Make a description about an QIDI Technology X-one2 with an Filament | $279 discount","completion":" Interestingly, this seems to use the Ultimakers as inspiration.

At a mere 140 x 140 x 140mm build area, it's a fraction of what the Ultimakers provide. It also doesn't support dual filament printing and doesn't provide automatic bed leveling, a camera, or internal lighting. That said, if you want to get a feel for how an enclosed printer might work and do it relatively inexpensively, the QIDI is worth a look.   Pros:    Enclosed print area  Extruder cartridges    Cons:    Very tiny build area  No automatic bed leveling  Kind of expensive for what it does  "}

I found a secondhand portable dishwasher and lugged it all the way home, only to discover my kitchen sink faucet wasn't compatible. As the dishes piled up, I turned away from the sink and instead toward Google.   There I found the holy grail: a faucet that's not only compatible with portable dishwashers, but also comes with a pull-down sprayer for easy hand-washing.

I like the sound of the  Tribit XFree Tune  headphones slightly better (they're $40), but this model is more comfortable. They come with a case, but the headphones don't fold flat (they fold up), and the case is pretty bulky as a result. That's their only drawback.  "}

I used the Free Pro 2 for a few days and they deliver good sound for their modest price, with decent clarity and deep but well-defined bass. They produce relatively big, open sound. They don't have such extra features as an ear-detection sensor so your music automatically pauses when you take one or both buds out of your ears, or an app that allows you to update their firmware.

Now, things have reached the point where the latest generation of connectivity is coming to devices that are almost as cheap as phones were back in the halcyon days of carrier-subsidized $200 flagships.

Its screw-on lid also kept all the liquid inside the mug, even when given the roller coaster treatment. The \"flip\" mechanism is basically a plastic flap that covers and plugs into the opening for sipping. Because the modest flap is so successful at managing leaks, however, it wasn't as easy to actually flip open one-handed, but then again there's a lot less lid in your face when you go to take a sip. At half the cost of the Zojirushi, with several size and color options, this would be an excellent choice for those looking for a solid travel mug on a smaller budget. "}

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Ryobi cordless 18-gauge brad nailer and cordless multi-tool combo-kit with an Save $40 on two indispensable tools for your dad this Father's Day discount","completion":" I bought myself this kit right after I  built my CNC . I found that the multi-tool was incredibly helpful in separating parts after the CNC carved them. Plus, a multi-tool is helpful throughout the house. You can use it to replace trim, cut out drywall for wall sockets, and a lot more. By adding different blades, you get a saw, a sander, a grinder, and a scraper.  The brad nailer was also very useful. I've used it so far to build four parts storage units, which I described as part of my  parts organizer project . I do have an air-powered brad nailer, but lugging the compressor to my work and then managing the air hose is tedious, especially compared to the battery-powered brad nailer.

{"prompt":"Make a description about an EarFun Air true wireless earbuds with an $42 with promo code discount","completion":"  Another  AirPods competitor? Yeah, but hear me out. A previous EarFun product, the  EarFun Free, is a CNET favorite , offering solid sound and some great features. The brand-new EarFun Air keeps the USB-C and wireless-charging options, but mimics the AirPods' pipe design and adds in-ear detection.  Cheapskate Jr. has been testing these for a couple months. (I received an early set.) His verdict: They sound really good and work really well overall, but he did have a couple issues. First, accidentally swiping the touch control often resulted in annoying volume jumps.  Second, on occasion he found the ear-detection feature too sensitive: Sometimes while making a small adjustment to an earbud, the music would stop and he'd have to pull the 'bud all the way out and reinsert it to get it started it again.  Still, noise-isolating waterproof earbuds for $42? Absolutely worth considering. (Use promo code  EAFAIR42  to get that price, noting that it  will not be active  until 11 a.m. PT today.) "}

The top spot went to the less expensive, dual-band  Asus RT-AC86U  instead -- and  Asus just released a follow-up to that router with support for Wi-Fi 6 . That new model, the  RT-AX86U , costs $250 -- just $5 more than this offer -- and it looked awfully impressive in our early speed tests, especially when it comes to managing latency. If I was in the market for a new gaming router, I'd skip this offer and just buy that one at full price, instead. "}

If a battery is especially old or fully drained, it may not resurrect. And I get that this is a not-cheap option compared to, say, buying some rechargeables. (Speaking of which, this works with not only disposable alkalines, but also all kinds of rechargeable batteries.) But if it helps keep alkalines out of landfills -- and lower your long-term battery costs -- isn't it worth considering?  The link below is for the charger itself. You can also add  this set of battery converters  (which allow AAs to be used as C and D cells) to your cart, then use promo code  PopularBogo  to get the converters free. "}

They're also simple to set up and wireless, so you can connect your computer -- or another device -- via Bluetooth. You just have to hit the pair button on the back to engage pairing mode. A set of speaker wires connects the two speakers (the left speaker has the amplifier and all the connectivity options).

But if you get a tight seal they sound good, with potent, well-defined bass and good detail (for a true wireless earbud). They also work decently as a headset for making calls, thanks to decent noise reduction that helps tamp down background noise so people can hear your voice better.   Battery life is rated at eight hours at moderate volume levels and these are fully waterproof with an IPX7 rating. "}

{"prompt":"Make a description about an MINGDA Magician X with an Filament | $399 from Amazon | $349 direct discount","completion":" The MINGDA Magician X checks off a lot of the boxes for a filament 3D printer. It's got a heated build plate, a direct-drive extruder (which makes flexible filaments print more reliably), a filament runout sensor, and it even sports automatic bed leveling. With a build area of 230x230x260mm, it can handle a wide range of mid-range sized prints.  Assembly was easy and straightforward. Print quality using PLA was quite good. I didn't test with ABS (because I'm not a fan of the stank), but this printer is spec'd to be able to reach 260 degrees C at the hot end. Unfortunately, the hot end isn't all metal, so you're not popping above 300 degrees, which does limit some materials. We would have liked to see a removable build plate because some of those prints adhered to the bed like a puppy to mommy during a thunderstorm. Our suggestion is to use blue tape, so you can peel the tape up and free the prints. Overall, though, the MINGDA Magician X is a definite win.  If you buy directly from the company, you may be able to save a few bucks. As of the time of writing, the price of the device was $349 directly from the Mingda website and $399 from Amazon.   Pros:    Direct-drive extruder  Automatic bed leveling  Easy to build    Cons:    No removable build plate  Prints are often very difficult to remove  "}

Perhaps the best thing about the new remote is you can simply say, \"Hey, Roku, find my remote,\" to make the clicker beep from wherever it is -- a game-changer for those who are constantly scouring the couch cushions. And Roku remotes can chew through batteries quickly, so using rechargeable ones means you no longer need to keep a stash of AAs on hand.   Roku also has a remote finder that works with any Roku remote with a built-in speaker, but that type of remote is not included with the original Streaming Stick 4K.

They fit most ears securely, including mine -- I run with them without a problem -- but others may find a better fit with the  Beats Fit Pro  and their integrated wing tips. Right now, you can save up to $50 on select color variants at Amazon, Best Buy and Target, which is just $10 more than the best price we've seen to date. "}

What we quite like about the Versa 3 is the six days of battery life. Once again, we have to look to the Apple Watch and mention that the Apple Watch can make, barely, a day on a charge. This: n  a week.  It comes equipped with a very clear AMOLED screen with 336x336 pixels, with enough brightness that it can be seen outside in all but the most intense sun. It does come with an always-on option, but using it results in the battery draining much faster. We like the hundreds of watch faces available, as well as quite a nice selection of additional apps.  And, once again, this watch comes with Fitbit's vaunted fitness tracking. If you want to get fit, lose weight, and track your progress, this may well be the watch for you.

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Nest Wifi with an A solid Wi-Fi 5 system (but don't spend more than $200) discount","completion":" Several years ago,  Google Wifi  became a breakout hit thanks to its easy setup and its ability to spread a fast, reliable Wi-Fi connection throughout your home for all of your connected devices. Then, there was Nest Wifi, a second-gen follow-up that adds in faster internet speeds and a better-looking design, plus Google Assistant smart speakers built into each satellite extender. It was an immediate standout in our tests, and our top-recommended mesh router prior to the arrival of Wi-Fi 6.  Nest Wifi debuted at $269 for a two-pack with the main router and one range-extending satellite, but now there's a new, third-gen follow-up called  Nest Wifi Pro  that adds in support for Wi-Fi 6E. That system failed to wow us, though -- and in the meantime, the second-gen Nest Wifi is still a solid mesh router that costs a lot less than before, down to as little as $140 for a two-pack when it's on sale.   On average, the Nest Wifi notched the fastest top speeds that I saw in my tests from any Wi-Fi 5 mesh router (and faster speeds than some of the Wi-Fi 6 systems I've tested, too). It also aced our mesh tests, never once dropping my connection as I moved about my home running speed tests. I never caught it routing my connection through the extender when connecting directly to the router was faster, either, which is a common pitfall for mesh connections.  Make no mistake, the lack of Wi-Fi 6 support means that the second-gen Nest Wifi is a somewhat dated system at this point, but it does include support for modern features like WPA3 security, device grouping and prioritization, and 4x4 MU-MIMO connections that offer faster aggregate speeds for devices like the  MacBook Pro  that can use multiple Wi-Fi antennas at once. It's also fully backward-compatible with previous-gen Google Wifi setups, which is a smart touch. All of it is easy to set up, easy to use and easy to rely on. Among dual-band mesh routers, I'd much rather have a top-of-the-line Wi-Fi 5 system than an entry-level Wi-Fi 6 system, and even among new competition, the Nest Wifi mesh router fits that bill. "}

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Allswell with an Best cheap mattress under $500 discount","completion":" The Allswell brand comes from one of the most popular and cheapest  retailers in the world, Walmart, which decided it wanted to enter the  bed-in-a-box mattress  game. Because hybrid beds' base layers are made with steel coils rather than foam, having the foam layer on top, they tend to be pricier to manufacture, and in turn, are sold for more. Though that isn't the case with this cheap mattress from Allswell. It's one of the most affordable  hybrid mattresses  I've ever seen, especially if you want a cheap queen or king mattress. I would even go as far as to say it's the best value mattress in our list.   In total this affordable mattress is around 10 inches thick -- similar to popular, standard foam mattress beds -- and in the bottom you can find a 6-inch layer of pocketed coils. That layer is the secret sauce to the Allswell's supportive design and is topped with a few foam layers, including the 0.75 inch of  gel memory foam  comfort layer quilted into the top cover. It's a suitable choice for all body sizes, including those over 230 pounds, and provides a moderate   amount of pressure relief.  It doesn't feel like memory foam where your handprint lasts a few moments before bouncing back to normal. It bounces back pretty quickly, and the pillow top adds a slight plushy feel. I think the innerspring layer makes it feel a little more firm, though, making me rate it around a six or seven out of 10 on the firmness scale. It's firmer than a medium, making it most suitable for back and stomach sleepers.  Prices are affordable, starting at $339 for a twin and go up to $539 for a California king, though you can often find it cheaper on sale.  "}

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Beats EP with an Best wired under $100 discount","completion":" Beats makes plenty of Bluetooth headphones with high price tags, but its entry-level EP wired headphones are a surprisingly good listening experience value. The list price is $100, but you can find it online for closer to $90 and sometimes less. The EP is an on-ear model that isn't as swanky as Beats' somewhat forgotten on-ear  Mixr , as well as the over-ear Executive and Pro models. But thanks to its reinforced metal frame, it reminds me of low-frills versions of those headphones. By low-frills, I mean it isn't incredibly flashy and it doesn't fold up or fold flat for travel (it has no hinges).  I liked the way they sounded and so did Steve Guttenberg, who once wrote CNET's  Audiophiliac  blog. These open back headphones exhibit the traits of a good  headphone:  They're clean and open-sounding, particularly for an on-ear  headphone , and there's enough treble detail to give them some sparkle. (In other words: They're not incredibly dynamic.)  The bass is a little accentuated -- this is Beats after all -- but it's not bloated or boomy. There's enough bass here to satisfy a low-end audiophile headphone lover but not so much to turn off someone who's looking for a more balanced, neutral-sound quality in a headphone. "}

For starters, it's simple to set up. You can use it in wired mode with an auxiliary 3.5mm cable or connect it to your computer via USB. But the majority of people will connect their devices to it via Bluetooth.  It comes with a hockey puck-sized controller (it's powered by two AAA batteries) that doubles as a Bluetooth transceiver between any Bluetooth-enabled audio device and the speaker system. You can skip tracks forward and back by tapping on the top of the puck and turning the dial to control volume. It's also worth noting that the speakers can be stood up vertically or horizontally. It's a nifty design.   The sound is good at close range but the bass isn't exactly tight (you can only expect so much for the price). This would work fine as an audio system in a small room, but just doesn't have the juice to sound good in a larger room (it's touted as having 80W of power but power ratings don't mean all that much).

But we have to replace the Ender 3's Top Pick slot from our last update with the Elegoo Neptune 2, which is everything the Ender 3 is, but less expensive and with generally smoother prints.  For a budget printer with a 220x220x250mm build area, the machine has a few decidedly non-budget features. It has a filament run-out sensor, so you can replace the spool and keep on printing if you run out of filament. And it has a removable build plate, which makes removing prints much easier and more reliable. Overall, an excellent printer and a favorite for folks setting up small print farms with inexpensive printers.   Pros:    Excellent price  Filament run-out sensor  Good print quality    Cons:    Manual bed leveling  Inconsistent availability  "}

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Hammer Anvil Minimalist with an Best minimalist wallet for under $15 discount","completion":" Five of the 12 wallets we tested had essentially the same basic design, and there are dozens -- if not hundreds -- of nearly identical models, all made in China, listed on Amazon. Prices start at just $10, for the Chelmon model, and other models generally cost between $15 and $20, though some colors, patterns and fabrics are more expensive than others. They're all about the size of a deck of playing cards, though they measure about 0.25 inch thick. The five we tested all have their brand names embossed on them:    Hammer Anvil RFID Blocking Minimalist Front Pocket Wallet    Kinzd Slim Wallet    Zitahli Slim   Minimalist Front Pocket Bifold Wallet    Buffway Slim Minimalist Front Pocket RFID Blocking Leather Wallet    Chelmon Slim Wallet RFID Front Pocket Wallet    Each of these slimmer wallets had the same basic elements: two or three card holder pockets on each side; a transparent window that lets you flash your ID without removing it; an inner space that can be used as a cash pocket or to stow a few more cards; RFID blocking on its card sleeve to block electronic pickpocketing of your credit and debit cards; and, in the case of the slightly pricier Zitahli, a magnetically attached money clip. (That company claims this money clip wallet can safely hold up to 25 bills, but when I put in just 10 folded bills, the magnets failed to connect.) But my top choice overall is the shorter, wider Hammer Anvil; I don't mind that it lacks the ID window, which, for all of its practicality, I find tacky and not befitting of our top wallets list.  I also really like the  Kinzd , which has a slightly broader design that separates it from the cookie-cutter field. It has a terrific inner pocket -- which is closed on one side only, allowing you to open it up wide -- that comes together firmly with a satisfying magnetic snap. "}

Now, for Prime Day, a 3-pack is marked down to $250, saving you $100 off the retail price.  The Arlo Essential cameras come with most of the same features we like about the more expensive Arlo Pro cameras -- namely, high-quality livestreams of whatever you're pointing them at, plus customizable alert notifications, color night vision, and other advanced features via the optional Arlo Smart cloud service, plus  compatibility with Alexa and the Google Assistant , or with  Apple HomeKit  provided you've got  a compatible Base Station or SmartHub . Just about the only thing we didn't like about these cameras when we tested them out was that Arlo stripped out the removable battery-pack design -- that means you'll need to take the whole camera inside when it's time to give it a charge (and the micro-USB charge cable Arlo provides is comically short).  That's a fair tradeoff at this price -- the Arlo Essential three-pack rarely drops below $280, and at $250, you're getting three cameras for less than you'd usually pay for two. Single cameras are  marked down to $100 each, as well , and if you'd like a longer battery life, the  Essential XL Cameras are on sale at a slight discount, too .

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Flashforge Creator Pro 2 with an Best under-$1,000 dual-extruder 3D printer discount","completion":" The Creator Pro 2 from  Flashforge  is a no-nonsense machine that gives the 10 times more expensive Ultimaker S5 a run for its money. Don't get me wrong; the S5 is still my favorite printer due to its incredibly easy filament loading mechanism. But that's $6,000, and this is under $700.   The Creator Pro 2 also does something the the S5 doesn't: it lets you run each extruder independently. That means you can use one for one color and one for another. You can use one for supports and one for the object. You can even use one extruder to print one object while simultaneously using the other extruder to print another object. Or you can have the printer print two of the same objects at once, without having to modify the original 3D model file. This makes for an incredibly flexible printer.  The machine has a solid metal frame. That solidity reduces vibrations and makes your prints come out better. The build plate is fixed in the machine, however, which is a bit of an annoyance. I found that painter's tape was the best solution for build plate adhesion that doesn't weld the print to the surface.   It does use a non-standard slicer, so it takes time to come up to speed. But once you've figured it out, you'll have a workhorse that won't give up.   Pros:    Those independent dual extruders  Extremely solid metal frame  For what it does, the price is impressive    Cons:    Manual leveling is a bit tedious  FlashPoint slicer is cumbersome  Build area could be bigger  "}

The Igloo MaxCold isn't the most amazing performer, but it's in the top five, above coolers that cost more than $200. If you want to splurge, Cabela's, Orca, and Yeti all have rotomolded designs that will keep their contents colder longer, but the small gap between those models and this $60-ish Igloo MaxCold make it hard to justify spending more.

Jason says the Luxe is tiny, but even so, the display is readable.  As with all Fitbits, it counts steps, tracks workouts, monitors sleep, and tracks your heart rate. It does not have a GPS, so if you want to track your run's path, you'll need to take your smartphone with you to get an accurate reading.  Even though battery life is advertised at five days, Jason somehow managed to push it to seven during his review. Overall, we really liked the Luxe. The only downside, really, is that the display can be too small for some people to read.   Read the review:    Fitbit Luxe review: A n  perfect fitness band   "}

These cheap wireless earbuds are similar to the Tribit X1 but are a little heavier and seem a little sturdier. As with the Tribit, how good you find the audio quality is dependent on how good a seal you get from one of the included ear tips, which are meant to drown out ambient noise.

Still, it sounds really good for a mini bookshelf-size speaker and has a glossy piano finish that gives it a premium look.  I reviewed an  earlier version of the A2 Plus  back in 2013. It now has Bluetooth connectivity with support for AptX streaming (for   AptX-compatible devices), but it still uses a standard 3.5mm-to-3.5mm audio cable that you plug into your device's headphone jack or auxiliary output.

{"prompt":"Make a description about an Xbox Live Gold with an $10 per month, or $60 per year discount","completion":" Xbox Live Gold is the online subscription service that started in 2002 for the original Xbox, and it allowed players to play multiplayer games online with voice chat. Since then it has offered more benefits such as special discounts and four free Xbox 360, Xbox One or Xbox Series games monthly. Microsoft will cease the inclusion of Xbox 360 games on Oct. 1, saying it reached its limit on bringing games from the older console to its catalog. A subscription for Xbox Live Gold costs $10 per month (with discounts available if you prepay for three, six or 12 months).  Adding to the nomenclature confusion: The online network has heretofore been known as Xbox Live, but will soon be changing its name to \" Xbox network .\" But it appears that Xbox Live Gold isn't going anywhere.  For now, you need Xbox Live Gold to play  any  online multiplayer games. But recently, it appears Microsoft might  change the rules  to allow Xbox gamers to play free-to-play games online such as Fortnite and Apex Legends.   But here's the important takeaway: Xbox Game Pass (see below) includes Xbox Live Gold, and adds access to dozens of games, too.

That said, shipping times are being pushed back by the hour, so act fast if you want a pair for yourself.  "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an Jabra Elite 75t: $80 with an Save $70 discount","completion":" The Jabra Elite 75t earned a CNET Editors' Choice award a couple years ago. Jabra recently released its  Elite 7 Pro  buds ($200), so now we're seeing the Elite 75t nicely discounted in all colors. The slightly more rugged  Elite Active 75t buds , now  $100 , are also on sale. "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an EarFun Free Pro with an Impressive for around $50 discount","completion":" The EarFun Free Pro buds offer strong features and sound for a modest price. They have active noise cancellation with a transparency mode, wireless charging and Bluetooth 5.2. Rated for seven hours of battery life without the noise-canceling function or about six with it activated, they're IPX5 water-resistant, which means they can withstand a sustained spray of water.  They sound very good for the money, with relatively clean, balanced sound and bass that has some kick to it -- they're pretty open-sounding. Lightweight and comfortable to wear, they have little fins that help keep them securely in your ears, and they're fairly discreet-looking.  Don't expect them to cancel noise as well as the  AirPods Pro , but they do provide some decent muffling. It's worth noting that you can use either the left or right earbud independently and there's a low-latency mode for video watching (and presumably gaming). Call quality was decent, too: Callers said they heard some background noise but it wasn't intrusive and they could hear my voice well. The touch controls were responsive.   If you're choosing between the EarFun Free Pro and the Mpow X3 (below), it comes down to the style of the earbuds. The X3 earbuds have a stick-style design, while these don't. "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an Earfun Free Pro with an Under $50 standout discount","completion":" From a design standpoint, the Earfun Free Pro seems identical to the Fiil T1XS. The Earfun Free Pro has better features, however, including active noise cancellation with a transparency mode, wireless charging and Bluetooth 5.2 (apparently, in some parts of the world there's a Fiil T1X Pro that adds noise canceling). They're rated for 7 hours of battery life without the noise-canceling function on, or about 6 hours with it on. They're IPX5 water-resistant, which means they can withstand a sustained spray of water.  These sound pretty impressive for their moderate price, with decent clarity and bass, and I recommend them and the Mpow X3 (see below) to folks looking for budget true wireless noise-canceling earbuds. These also work pretty well for making calls and they currently cost less than the Mpow X3. Don't expect stellar noise canceling, but it is somewhat effective. They list for $60 but on Amazon, there's often an instant coupon that brings the price down by a few bucks.  "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an Earfun Free Pro 2 with an Impressive for around $60 discount","completion":" I was a fan of Earfun's earlier Free Pro earbuds, which offer good sound for around $50 and have little sport fins that help keep them in your ears securely. Now Earfun has released the Earfun Pro 2 buds with aluminum alloy caps, improved noise canceling and a couple of extra microphones that help boost voice-calling performance.  The Free Pro 2 deliver good sound for their modest price, with decent clarity and deep but well-defined bass. They produce relatively big, open sound. They don't have such extra features as an ear-detection sensor so your music automatically pauses when you take one or both buds out of your ears or an app that allows you to update their firmware. But they're lightweight, should fit most ears well and have decent noise canceling along with a transparency mode (it's not as good as the AirPods Pro's transparency mode, which is hard to beat).  I found the voice-calling performance good but not great. They did an acceptable job reducing background noise and picking up my voice in noisy environments but they aren't necessarily top-notch in this department. Battery life is rated at up to 6 hours, they're IPX5 splash-proof, and their elongated case (it charges wirelessly) is compact and lightweight. It's better designed than the Free Pro's case.  "}
{"prompt":"Make a description about an Earfun Free Pro: $48 with an Save $12 with code discount","completion":" The Earfun Free Pro earbuds are brand new to the market. I've been using them for a week or so and have run with them a few times (they're lightweight and fit securely). While they list for $60, there's an instant 10%-off coupon. Then you can apply the extra 10%-off code  FREEPRO10  at checkout at Amazon, which gets you a total discount of $12. They sound really good for the money.    From a design standpoint, they seem identical to the Fiil T1XS, which is also on sale for $48. However, the Earfun Free Pro has better features, including active noise cancellation with a transparency mode, wireless charging and Bluetooth 5.2. They're rated for seven hours of battery life without the noise-canceling function on (or about six hours with it on).
